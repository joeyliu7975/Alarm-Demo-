# Alarm Demo

1. This whole project duplicated one of iPhone's default apps -- Clock.

2. This project is for personal practice purposes only.

3. In order to practice and get familiar with Swift's syntax such as TableView, PickerView and other assoicated syntax. I had looked into and referenced to numerous articles and documents on the internet, hence, any resemblance to the contents you found on stackoverflow is coincendential.
